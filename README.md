# 3D Plotting Program

This program demonstrates 3D plotting in Python using `matplotlib`. It visualizes a helical line alongside scattered points in 3D space, with the scattered points' color intensity varying based on their height (`z` value).

## Features

- **Helical Line Visualization**: Generates a gray helical line using sine and cosine functions.
- **3D Scatter Plot**: Displays scattered points around the helical line, with colors based on their `z` position, using a green colormap.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjustable parameters for the helix and scattered points, allowing for versatile 3D visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.x recommended). Additionally, you will need the `matplotlib` library. If you don't have `matplotlib` installed, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib

Installation
Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Plotting-Program.git

Navigate to the Program Directory

Change into the program's directory:
cd 3D-Plotting-Program

Running the Program
Execute the program by running:
python plot3d.py
This command will open a window displaying the 3D plot with the helical line and scattered points.

Customization
You can customize the plot by adjusting the parameters for the helix and scatter plot within the plot3d.py file. For example, modify the linspace function parameters to change the helix or adjust the random seed for different scatter patterns.

Contributing
Contributions to enhance the functionality, improve visualization, or extend the customization options are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
